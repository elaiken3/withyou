# WithYou — Product Vision

WithYou exists to support executive function without shame.

This document defines what the app *is*, what it *is not*, and how decisions
should be made when tradeoffs arise.

## The Problem We’re Solving

People with ADHD and executive-function challenges struggle with:
- holding multiple thoughts
- starting tasks
- time blindness
- emotional overwhelm caused by reminders

The problem is not motivation.
The problem is cognitive load and emotional friction.

---

## What WithYou Is

- A safe external brain
- A focus protector
- A task initiation assistant
- A compassionate companion

WithYou helps users:
- capture thoughts instantly
- focus on one thing at a time
- recover gracefully when plans fall apart

---

## What WithYou Is Not

WithYou is not:
- a productivity scoreboard
- a habit tracker
- a streak-based system
- a task punishment engine

Anything that pressures, shames, or gamifies consistency does not belong here.

---

## Design Commitments

We commit to:

- One thing at a time
- Minimal decisions
- Neutral handling of missed tasks
- Short focus windows
- Emotional safety over optimization

If a feature conflicts with these, it does not ship.

---

## How We Measure Success

We do not measure:
- daily active usage
- task volume
- completion streaks

We care about:
- users returning after falling behind
- reduced anxiety
- increased task initiation
- trust in the app

---

## The Final Test

Before shipping any feature, ask:

> Would this feel safe to open on a bad day?

If the answer is no, rethink it.
