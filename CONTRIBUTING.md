# Contributing to WithYou

Thank you for your interest in contributing.
Before writing code, please read this carefully.

WithYou is not a typical productivity app.
Its philosophy matters as much as its features.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

WithYou is built for people with ADHD and executive-function challenges.
That means:

- Emotional safety is a feature
- Reducing cognitive load matters more than speed
- “Helpful” is more important than “powerful”

If a contribution increases pressure, guilt, or noise — it will be rejected.

## 🚦 Contribution Guidelines

### What We Welcome
- Accessibility improvements
- Focus and initiation support
- Calm UI enhancements
- Thoughtful copy changes
- Bug fixes that reduce friction
- Performance improvements that don’t add complexity

---

### What We Do Not Accept
- Streaks, scores, or gamification
- “Overdue” mechanics
- Shame-based language
- Infinite task lists
- Features that punish inconsistency
- Productivity metrics exposed to users

---

## 🗣 Language & Tone

UI copy should be:
- Calm
- Reassuring
- Direct but kind
- Non-judgmental

Avoid:
- “You should…”
- “Don’t forget…”
- “Overdue”
- “Failed”
- “Missed”

Preferred language:
- “Still relevant?”
- “Want help starting?”
- “That counted.”

---

## 🛠 Technical Notes

- SwiftUI + SwiftData
- iOS 17+
- Voice-first friendly where possible
- Accessibility labels are expected
- Favor clarity over cleverness

When in doubt:
> Choose the implementation that requires fewer decisions from the user.

## 🧪 Testing Expectations

When adding or modifying features, consider:
- What happens if the user ignores this?
- What happens if they fall behind?
- Does this feel safe to return to after a bad week?

If the answer is “this might stress someone out” — rethink it.

---

## 📦 Pull Requests

Please include:
1. What problem this solves
2. Why it helps ADHD users specifically
3. Any UX or emotional tradeoffs considered

Large features should be discussed before implementation.

---

## 🧭 Final Rule

If a feature makes users feel:
- rushed
- guilty
- watched
- judged

It does not belong in WithYou.

Thank you for helping build something humane.
