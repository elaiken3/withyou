# WithYou

**A compassionate focus and reminder app for ADHD brains.**

WithYou helps people capture thoughts, protect focus, and start tasks —
without guilt, pressure, or productivity shame.

This is not a to-do app.
This is an executive-function support system.

## 🌱 Why WithYou Exists

People with ADHD don’t struggle because they’re lazy.
They struggle because working memory, task initiation, and time perception
are unreliable.

Most productivity apps make this worse by:
- piling up overdue tasks
- punishing missed reminders
- demanding streaks and consistency
- overwhelming users with lists

**WithYou does the opposite.**

## 🧠 Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Every feature must respect these rules:

1. One thing at a time
2. Thoughts are not obligations
3. Missed tasks are neutral
4. Short focus windows are valid
5. Emotional safety > optimization
6. The app never shames or nags

If a feature violates these, it does not ship.

## ✨ What WithYou Does

### Capture (External Brain)
- Instantly capture thoughts via text or voice
- Siri / Shortcuts supported
- Time-aware parsing:
  - If a time is detected → scheduled
  - If not → Inbox
- During Focus Sessions → routed to Focus Dump

Language is minimal:
> “Saved.”  
> “I’ve got it.”

---

### Inbox (Mental Parking Lot)
- Holds thoughts without forcing decisions
- Nothing is overdue
- Nothing nags

Actions:
- Schedule
- Make smaller
- Not needed

---

### Verbose Reminders
Reminders help users **start**, not just remember.

Each reminder includes:
- What the task is
- A suggested start step
- Gentle notification actions

No red text. No overdue panic.

---

### Focus Sessions
Focus Sessions protect attention for short periods.

Flow:
1. Choose one focus task
2. Brain dump distracting thoughts
3. Start 25–60 minute timer
4. Add thoughts without stopping
5. End session
6. Decide what to do with parked thoughts

During a Focus Session:
> Nothing else matters.

---

### Refocus Button
A micro-reset for spirals and distraction:
- 30-second timer
- Guided breathing
- A short mantra (profile-based)

Accessible anywhere in the app.

---

### Profiles
Profiles allow personalization without complexity:
- Name
- Reminder tone (gentle / firm)
- Default focus length
- Preferred mantra
- Time-of-day defaults

Supports multiple users or work/personal modes.

---

## 🛟 Emotional Safety Features

### Forgiveness Logic
Missed reminders:
- Do not repeat endlessly
- Do not turn red
- Ask once: “Still relevant?”

Options:
- Today
- Later
- Not needed

Then the app lets go.

---

### No Shame Mechanics
Explicitly avoided:
- Streaks
- Scores
- “Overdue” labels
- Productivity dashboards

Completion feedback is gentle:
> “Nice.”  
> “That counted.”
