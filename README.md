# WithYou

**A compassionate focus and reminder app for ADHD brains.**

WithYou helps people capture thoughts, protect focus, and start tasks —
without guilt, pressure, or productivity shame.

This is not a to-do app.
This is an executive-function support system.

---

## 🌱 Why WithYou Exists

People with ADHD don’t struggle because they’re lazy.
They struggle because working memory, task initiation, and time perception
are unreliable.

Most productivity apps make this worse by:
- piling up overdue tasks
- punishing missed reminders
- demanding streaks and consistency
- overwhelming users with lists

**WithYou does the opposite.**

---

## 🧠 Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Every feature must respect these rules:

1. One thing at a time
2. Thoughts are not obligations
3. Missed tasks are neutral
4. Short focus windows are valid
5. Emotional safety > optimization
6. The app never shames or nags

If a feature violates these, it does not ship.

## ✨ What WithYou Does

### Capture (External Brain)
- Instantly capture thoughts via text or voice
- Siri / Shortcuts supported
- Time-aware parsing:
  - If a time is detected → scheduled
  - If not → Inbox
- During Focus Sessions → routed to Focus Dump

Language is minimal:
> “Saved.”  
> “I’ve got it.”

---

### Inbox (Mental Parking Lot)
- Holds thoughts without forcing decisions
- Nothing is overdue
- Nothing nags

Actions:
- Schedule
- Make smaller
- Not needed

---

### Verbose Reminders
Reminders help users **start**, not just remember.

Each reminder includes:
- What the task is
- A suggested start step
- Gentle notification actions

No red text. No overdue panic.

---

### Focus Sessions
Focus Sessions protect attention for short periods.

Flow:
- Choose one focus task
- Brain dump distracting thoughts
- Start a short timer (25–60 min)
- Pause / resume as needed
- Add thoughts without stopping
- Extend time if helpful
- End session
- Decide what to do with parked thoughts

During a Focus Session:
> Nothing else matters.

---

### Refocus Button
A micro-reset for spirals and distraction:
- 30-second timer
- Guided breathing
- A short mantra (profile-based)

Accessible anywhere in the app.

---

### Profiles
Profiles allow personalization without complexity:
- Name
- Reminder tone (gentle / firm)
- Default focus length
- Preferred mantra
- Time-of-day defaults

Supports multiple users or work/personal modes.

---

## 🛟 Emotional Safety Features

### Forgiveness Logic
Missed reminders:
- Do not repeat endlessly
- Do not turn red
- Ask once: “Still relevant?”

Options:
- Today
- Later
- Not needed

Then the app lets go.

---

### No Shame Mechanics
Explicitly avoided:
- Streaks
- Scores
- “Overdue” labels
- Productivity dashboards

Completion feedback is gentle:
> “Nice.”  
> “That counted.”

---
## 🚧 Current Status (TestFlight Build)

WithYou is currently in **early TestFlight testing**.

What’s implemented today:
- Capture → Inbox → Reminder flow
- Focus Sessions with:
  - Brain dump
  - Pause / resume
  - Extend time
  - Wrap-up review
- Gentle focus-end notifications
- Refocus (30-second reset)
- Profiles for personalization
- Tab-based navigation (Today / Focus / Inbox / Capture / Profiles)

What’s intentionally *not* finished yet:
- Daily planning UI
- Session history
- Analytics or insights
- Advanced Siri / Shortcuts
- Energy-aware features

If something feels incomplete, that’s expected — this phase is about:
**Does this feel emotionally safe? Does it reduce friction?**

## 🧪 How to Give Feedback

If you’re testing WithYou via TestFlight:

- Use the app normally — there’s no “right” way
- If something feels stressful, confusing, or surprisingly calming, that’s valuable feedback
- Use TestFlight’s “Send Feedback” feature for bugs or thoughts

Helpful feedback questions:
- Where did you feel relief?
- Where did friction remain?
- Did anything feel unintentionally pressuring?
- Did the language feel safe?

You’re not testing productivity.
You’re testing emotional load.
