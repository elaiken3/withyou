# WithYou

**An achievement app for ADHD brains.**

### Audience
--------

A person with ADHD or a guardian with an ADHD child

### Description
-----------

WithYou is an executive-function support system that helps people with ADHD complete tasks by capturing thoughts, protecting focus, and prioritizing completing over starting tasks.

It reduces mental overload so people can focus on one thing at a time --- with pride, focus, and confidence.

This is not a traditional to-do app.

The goal is getting things done.

For many people with ADHD, that starts with clearing the mind and protecting attention long enough to make rewardable progress. .

## 🌱 Why WithYou Exists

People with ADHD struggle with executive function that help them:

-   decide what to work on

-   start a task

-   hold steps in working memory

-   manage time and attention

-   resist distractions

-   stop or switch tasks intentionally

and experience:

-   task paralysis (wanting to act but feeling stuck)

-   mental overload from holding too many thoughts at once

-   losing focus shortly after starting

-   difficulty returning to a task once interrupted

In these moments, the problem isn't a lack of goals or desire to finish --- it's that the mind is too cluttered or distracted to begin and sustain focus. .

WithYou addresses this by:

-   capturing thoughts so they don't compete for attention

-   protecting focus so one task can actually progress

-   making starting small and safe, so finishing becomes possible

Most productivity apps make this worse by:

-   piling up overdue tasks

-   punishing missed reminders

-   demanding streaks and consistency

-   overwhelming users with lists

WithYou does the opposite.

It lowers the cognitive load required to start and stay focused --- so tasks can actually get done.

## 🧠 Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)
-----------------------------------

Every feature must respect these rules:

1.  One thing at a time

2.  Thoughts are not obligations

3.  Missed tasks are neutral

4.  Short focus windows are valid

5.  Emotional safety > optimization

6.  The app never shames or nags

If a feature violates these, it does not ship.

## ✨ What WithYou Does
-------------------

### Capture (External Brain)

-   Instantly capture thoughts via text or voice

-   Siri / Shortcuts supported

-   Time-aware parsing:

-   If a time is detected → scheduled

-   If not → Inbox

-   During Focus Sessions → routed to Focus Dump

Language is minimal:

"Saved."\
"I've got it."

* * * * *

### Inbox (Mental Parking Lot)

-   Holds thoughts without forcing decisions

-   Nothing is overdue

-   Nothing nags

Actions:

-   Schedule

-   Make smaller

-   Not needed

* * * * *

### Verbose Reminders

Reminders help users start, not just remember.

Each reminder includes:

-   What the task is

-   A suggested start step

-   Gentle notification actions

No red text. No overdue panic.

* * * * *

### Focus Sessions

Focus Sessions protect attention for short periods.

Flow:

1.  Choose one focus task

2.  Brain dump distracting thoughts

3.  Start a short timer (25--60 min)

4.  Pause / resume as needed

5.  Add thoughts without stopping

6.  Extend time if helpful

7.  End session

8.  Decide what to do with parked thoughts

During a Focus Session:

Nothing else matters.

* * * * *

### Refocus Button

A micro-reset for spirals and distraction:

-   30-second timer

-   Guided breathing

-   A short mantra (profile-based)

Accessible anywhere in the app.

* * * * *

### Profiles

Profiles allow personalization without complexity:

-   Name

-   Reminder tone (gentle / firm)

-   Default focus length

-   Preferred mantra

-   Time-of-day defaults

Supports multiple users or work/personal modes.

* * * * *

## 🛟 Emotional Safety Features
----------------------------

### Forgiveness Logic

Missed reminders:

-   Do not repeat endlessly

-   Do not turn red

-   Ask once: "Still relevant?"

Options:

-   Today

-   Later

-   Not needed

Then the app lets go.

* * * * *

### No Shame Mechanics

Explicitly avoided:

-   Streaks - internal motivation 

-   Scores - it's not about getting the high score, it's about rewarding progress toward the goal.

-   "Overdue" labels - intentions are not time bound or fixed.  The focus is situational relevancy and and urgency of the current moment and experience.

-   Productivity dashboards - dashboards focus on the current experience, we are focused on the trend of progress, not the current statistics.

Completion feedback is gentle:

- "Nice."\
- "That counted."

## 🧪 How to Give Feedback
-----------------------

If you're testing WithYou via TestFlight:

-   Use the app normally --- there's no "right" way

-   If something feels stressful, confusing, or surprisingly calming, that's valuable feedback

-   Use TestFlight's "Send Feedback" feature for bugs or thoughts

Helpful feedback questions:

-   Where did you feel relief?

-   Where did friction remain?

-   Did anything feel unintentionally pressuring?

-   Did the language feel safe?

You're not testing productivity. You're testing emotional load.
